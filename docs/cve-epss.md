#### 9. CVE add EPSS (`EPSS`) (`cve-epss`)

* Source collections: `nvd_cve_vertex_collection` (`type==note` objects only)

CVE Note objects have EPSS scores, e.g.

```json
    "x_epss": [
        {
            "date": "2024-08-18",
            "percentile": "0.328570000",
            "score": "0.000750000" 
        }
    ]
```

EPSS scores are updated daily. As such a user should be able to update EPSS scores.

EPSS data is downloaded using the endpoint. It will return the score for the current day.

```shell
GET https://api.first.org/data/v1/epss?cve=CVE-XXXX-XXXX
```

Running the script will update CVEs with the latest available EPSS data.

Should also add specific flag for this mode only `--cve-ids`. Here a user can pass a list of CVE IDs. In this case, only the CVE IDs passed will be updated. This is useful because often a user only wants to updated recent cves, and not very old ones. Should also be able to pass regex values for this property (e.g. `2024-2\n\n\n\n`). Will also work with `modified_min` flag.

On update a new version of the `note` object will be created, with the additional record added to the `x_epss` property.

```json
    "x_epss": [
        {
            "date": "2024-08-19",
            "percentile": "0.428920000",
            "score": "0.000900000"
        },
        {
            "date": "2024-08-18",
            "percentile": "0.328570000",
            "score": "0.000750000" 
        }
    ]
```

The `modified` time will also be updated to match the EPSS `date` value

Sll other fields will be the same.

The `_is_latest` will also be updated accordingly by stix2arango for the new and old object accordingly (as will embedded refs between note and vulnerability).
