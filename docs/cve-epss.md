#### 9. CVE add EPSS (`EPSS`) (`cve-epss`)

* Source collections: `nvd_cve_vertex_collection` (`type==vulnerability` objects only)

CVE Vulnerability objects have EPSS scores, e.g.

```json
    "x_cvss": {
        "v3_1": {
            "baseScore": 4.8,
            "baseSeverity": "MEDIUM",
            "exploitabilityScore": 1.7,
            "impactScore": 2.7,
            "vectorString": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N"
        }
    },
    "x_epss": {
        "date": "2024-08-18",
        "percentile": "0.328570000",
        "score": "0.000750000"
    }
```

EPSS scores are updated daily. As such a user should be able to update EPSS scores.

EPSS data is downloaded using the endpoint. It will return the score for the current day.

```shell
GET https://api.first.org/data/v1/epss?cve=CVE-XXXX-XXXX
```

Running the script will update CVEs with the latest available CVSS data. The `modified` time of each CVE will be updated accordingly.

Should also add specific flag for this mode only `--cve-ids`. Here a user can pass a list of CVE IDs. In this case, only the CVE IDs passed will be updated. This is useful because often a user only wants to updated recent cves, and not very old ones. Should also be able to pass regex values for this property (e.g. `2024-2\n\n\n\n`).

On update a new version of the `vulnerability` object will be created.

On update all other fields will be the same except for the EPSS date and the `modified` time that will reflect when the script got the update.

The `_is_latest` will also be updated accordingly by stix2arango for the new and old object accordingly.
